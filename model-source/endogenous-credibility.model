% Brief discussion of the nonlinearities
%
% # The Phillips curve has the following form:
%    $$ \pi_t - \pi_{t-1} = \beta_t^\star \, \mathrm E_t \left[ \pi_{t+1} -
%    \pi_t \right] + \gamma \tfrac{1}{\delta} \left( \exp\delta y_t - 1
%    \right) + \epsilon_{\pie, t}, $$
% where the forward-lookingness of inflation, $\hat\beta$, is affected by
% central-bank crediblity, $c_t \in [0, 1]$:
% $$ \beta^\star_t := c_t \cdot \beta. $$
% and $\beta\in(0, 1)$ is a fixed parameter (attained at full credibility).
% In other words, the lower the central bank credibility, the greater
% persistence in inflation, and vice versa.
%
% The function that describes the Phillips curve nonlinearity, i.e.
% $\left( \exp\delta y_t - 1 \right)/\delta$ is an m-file function saved
% under the name `nonlinpc.m`. It is adapted so as to be able to handle the
% special case with $\delta=0$ (a linear Phillips curve).
%
% # The law of motion for credibility is as follows:
%    $$ c_t = \psi c_{t-1} + (1-\psi) s_t,
%    $$
% where $s_t$ is a ``signal'' by which the credibility is updated. The
% signal is given by
%     $$ s_t = \exp \left(\omega\hat\pie^4_{t-1}\right)^2
%     $$
% where $\hat\pie^4_t$ is the deviation of current four-quarter inflation,
% $\pie^4_t$, from the target, $\tau_t$:
%    $$ \hat\pie^4_t = \pi_t - \tau_t.
%    $$
% In other words, credibility is damaged every time inflation deviates from
% the target (either way), and the extent of it increases with the square
% of the deviation.
